# Arrays in x86 Assembly

This project is a simple implementation to demonstrate how to work with arrays in x86 Assembly, based on the article [Arrays in x86 Assembly](https://dev.to/leandronsp/construindo-um-web-server-em-assembly-x86-parte-i-introducao-14p5) by Leandro Nascimento.
The goal is to explore basic concepts of array manipulation in Assembly language, including array creation, manipulation, and iteration over integer arrays.

## Features
  - Definition of arrays in memory.
  - Iteration over arrays using Assembly loop instructions.
  - Manipulation of array elements.
  - Output of results to the terminal using system calls.
